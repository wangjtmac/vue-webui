# ng-book 2: The Complete Guide to Angular 2 Sample Code

## Organization

Hi! Here's the sample code for the book.

It's organized by `chapter/topic`. Generally, in the book we call out where you can find each code example. 

## Running the code

We're still unifying how each example should be run. Generally, you'll need to `npm install` and then see the `README.md` in each project for instructions to get the example going.

## THIS IS AN EARLY RELEASE

Angular 2 is still very young so some of the API is probably going to change. Also, we're still normalizing a build process for these examples, sorry for any clutter you might find.
We'll send you an email when we have updates available.

## Feedback & Bug Reports

We're currently developing the book and this code. If you have any feedback on things that aren't clear, or find any bugs just email us at: us@fullstack.io

Cheers!

Nate, Felipe, and the ng-book 2 team
